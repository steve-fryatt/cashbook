Important Upgrade Information for users of CashBook 1.40          2 June 2018
=============================================================================

  CashBook 1.40 contained a bug which would corrupt the Next Cheque numbers
  associated with accounts. Users upgrading from CashBook 1.40 should read
  this release note before starting to upgrade their copy to a later version.
  

Does this affect me?
--------------------

  1) Are you currently using CashBook 1.40?

  2) Do any of your accounts have a 'Next cheque' number associated with
     them? Note that the 'Next pay-in slip' field is not affected.

  If the answer to either of these questions is "no", then this problem does
  NOT affect you. You should proceed directly to upgrading, as described in
  "How do I upgrade my copy of CashBook?" below.


If I might be affected, what do I need to do?
---------------------------------------------

  Before upgrading your copy of CashBook 1.40, quit any copies which are on
  the iconbar and start a copy of CashBook 1.41 or later (either from the
  download archive, or by copying it to another location on your hard disc --
  do NOT overwrite your copy of CashBook 1.40 yet).

  Load any files which have been saved by CashBook 1.40 and contain accounts
  using the 'Next cheque' field into this newer version of CashBook. Open the
  Accounts list window (click Menu over the Transaction window, and select
  'Accounts->List accounts').

  Open the Edit Account dialogue for any account which might contain a next
  cheque number (click Menu over it in the Accounts List, and select 'Edit
  account...'). If the 'Next cheque' field contains a valid number, the file
  is OK. If it contains a corrupted number (often a string of zeros), make a
  note of the file for the next step.

  If the cheque numbers in all of your files were OK, then again, this
  problem does NOT affect you. However, do NOT load the files into
  CashBook 1.40 again -- instead, proceed to upgrading your application as
  described in "How do I upgrade my copy of CashBook?" below.


So I have some corrupted cheque numbers, what now?
--------------------------------------------------

  If the previous step identified any files with corrupt cheque numbers, quit
  the copy of CashBook from the iconbar and load CashBook 1.40 for one final
  time.

  Load each corrupted file into CashBook 1.40, save it and close it again. Do
  this ONLY ONCE for each file.

  When each affected file has been loaded and saved, proceed to upgrade your
  copy of CashBook 1.40.


How do I upgrade my copy of CashBook?
-------------------------------------

  CashBook 1.40 can be upgraded in the usual way: delete the existing
  application, and replace it with version 1.41 (or later).

  If you saved a temporary copy of the new version somewhere for the previous
  checks, make sure that you delete it to avoid any confusion later on.

  Note that loading files back into a copy of CashBook 1.40 in the future,
  and saving them again, will restore this corruption again. It is wise to
  make sure that you do not have any copies of this version of CashBook, or
  any test builds with version numbers of less than r4686, remaining anywhere
  on your computers.

  That's it! Sorry for the inconvenience of having to check your files.
