Introduction & Installation
---------------------------

  CashBook is a home accounts manager, which can be used to keep track of
  home or club accounts.  The system is based around transactions, which
  correspond to those on bank, building society and credit card statements.
  These transactions transfer money between accounts, or to and from analysis
  headings.

  Transactions into and out of accounts can be reconciled against statements,
  making it quick and easy to spot discrepancies and errors.  Budgets can be
  set for transactions into and out of analysis headings, so that income and
  expenditure over time can be monitored and recorded.  Various reporting
  options allow detailed information to be produced on many aspects of the
  accounts and transactions.

  Entering transactions can be done in two ways.  In addition to manual
  entry, regular payments such as standing orders, direct debits or salary
  payments can be automated.  Pending transactions up to a specified date can
  be included in any future balance figures for accounts.


  Installation
  ------------

  CashBook is designed to work with RISC OS 4 or later; it can be used on
  RISC OS 3, but a copy of the Nested Wimp must be installed.  It is
  26/32-bit neutral, and should therefore run on all hardware systems as long
  as the 32-bit Shared C Library is installed.  If required, this can be
  found on the Castle website at http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/system.shtml.

  To install, copy the !CashBook application from the archive into a suitable
  place on your hard disc.  It can be run from a floppy disc, but this is not
  recommended.  Once installed, double-click on the !CashBook application in
  the Filer window to load it on to the iconbar.


  Getting started
  ---------------

  CashBook is a multi-file editor which behaves in a similar way to many
  other RISC OS applications.  Double-clicking on its icon in a filer window
  will load it on to the iconbar, ready for files to be loaded or created.
  Several different sets of accounts can be worked on at the same time: the
  only limitations on the number of files loaded, and on the number of
  transactions, accounts, headings or standing orders in a file, are imposed
  by memory and processing speed.

  In addition to this manual, CashBook fully supports interactive help.  To
  get information on any aspect of the application, simply load a help client
  and point to the relevant part of a window or dialogue box.

  To create a new file, click Select on CashBook's iconbar icon; this opens a
  new transaction window.  The transaction window is the central part of a
  cashbook file: all the other windows associated with that file can be
  opened from here, and clicking Menu over it will bring up the main menu.
  If the transaction window is closed, the file is removed from memory along
  with any associated windows.

  Before transactions can be entered into the window, accounts and analysis
  headings must be set up.  Details of these can be accessed from the main
  menu, and also from the transaction window toolbar.  Standing orders, which
  are in fact any pre-defined transactions that occur on a regular basis
  (such as salary payments, direct debits and - of course - standing orders),
  can also be accessed in this way.

  Many other operations that can be carried out on a cashbook file can be
  accessed through the main menu or the transaction window toolbar.  Other
  windows in CashBook have their own menus and toolbars which allow access to
  a subset of functions available from the main menu, as well as additional
  options which are not applicable elsewhere.


  Saving and loading files
  ------------------------

  CashBook files can be saved by following 'File - Save' from the main menu.
  From this dialogue box, the file icon can be dragged to a filer window in
  the standard manner.  If a full filename is already present in the
  transaction window's titlebar, clicking on the menu entry will save the
  file immediately.

  Information on the current file can be found by following 'File - Info'
  from the main menu.  This gives details of the file's location on disc (as
  shown in the transaction window's titlebar), the date the file was last
  saved and whether the file has been modified since then.  If the file has
  been modified since the last save, an asterisk will also be shown at the
  end of the filename in the transaction window's titlebar.  The file
  information window also shows details of the number of transactions,
  accounts, analysis headings, standing orders and transaction presets in the
  file.

  If CashBook is loaded on the iconbar, or has at least been seen by the
  filer, double-clicking on a cashbook file will load it in the usual way.
  Alternatively, files can also be dragged to the application's iconbar icon.


  Displaying and entering monetary values
  ---------------------------------------

  Throughout CashBook, a standard format is used to display and enter
  monetary values.  Plain numbers are used, without any currency symbols, to
  allow the application to be used in different countries.  The number of
  decimal places used is read from the computer's territory settings,
  although these can be overridden in the CashBook configuration if
  necessary.

  As standard, zero values will not be displayed (the location being left
  blank instead); this can be changed if required.  The decimal point and
  method of displaying negative values (a minus sign or brackets around the
  value) can also be set to override the current territory defaults.

  When entering numbers, trailing zeros will be added after the decimal point
  if any are missing.  Thus, assuming sterling or a similar currency,
  entering "236.76" would result in 236.76 being accepted, while "236.7"
  would produce 236.70 and "236" would give 236.00.

  Negative values can be entered using the method for displaying negative
  numbers that is currently in force.  If a minus sign is selected, they
  should be entered in this way: "-12.34".  If parentheses are in use, values
  should be enclosed thus: "(12.34)".


  Displaying and entering dates
  -----------------------------

  Date entry and display is also handled in a uniform way, using the
  "DD-MM-YYYY" format.  The separator used for display is set in the
  configuration, and can be changed as required.  Multiple separators can be
  specified for entering dates.

  When entering dates, it is possible to use two-digit years.  These will be
  expanded into four-digit years such that 80 to 99 become 1980 to 1999,
  while 00 to 79 become 2000 to 2079.  Years must fall in the range 100 to
  9999.

  Either the year, or the month and year, can be omitted, in which case the
  current year (and month) will usually be substituted.  The exception is
  when entering transaction dates, when the year and month are taken from the
  previous line if these are present - allowing several transactions in the
  same month to be entered quickly.


  Working with windows and dialogue boxes
  ---------------------------------------

  The column widths in the various windows in CashBook can be adjusted by
  dragging the right-hand end of the column title with the mouse.  The widths
  used in individual windows are saved in the cashbook file, with the
  exception of statement views where all the windows share the same width
  settings, which are updated whenever a column is adjusted in any window.

  The transaction window, standing order list window and statement view
  windows can all have their contents sorted on any of the columns of data.
  Clicking Select on a column heading (away from the drag target at the
  right-hand end) will sort that column into ascending order, while clicking
  Adjust will sort into descending order; this can also be achieved through
  the window's sort dialogue.  The column currently being sorted is shown by
  a small arrow pointing up or down in the selected column's heading.

  The left-most button on every CashBook toolbar (except for the transaction
  window toolbar) is an upwards-pointing black arrow: the 'parent window'
  button.  Clicking on this will bring the transaction window belonging to
  the window in question to the front, which can be useful if there are a lot
  of other windows on the screen.

  The transaction window contains the main menu in CashBook, which allows
  access to almost all of the application's features.  Most of the other
  windows have their own local menus with options relating to the contents:
  invariably these contain export and print options.

  All of the dialogue boxes in CashBook comply with the RISC OS Style Guide,
  and should be familiar in use.  It may be worth remembering that while
  Select clicks on the default 'action button' (usually at the bottom right,
  with a label like 'Create', 'Update' or similar) will act on the settings
  in the dialogue and close it, Adjust clicks will use the settings while
  leaving the dialogue open.

  In a similar way, Select clicks on the adjacent 'Cancel' button will close
  the dialogue and forget any changes to the contents, while Adjust clicks
  will simply restore the contents of the dialogue to the values that were
  there when it opened.

  When opening dialogue boxes, the previous contents will be remembered by
  default.  To open an empty dialogue from a toolbar, use an Adjust-click
  instead.  This behaviour can be reversed from the 'General' section of the
  choices window.



Beginners' Tutorial
-------------------

  Before starting to look at the features of CashBook in detail, it may be
  helpful to work through an example of setting up accounts and analysis
  headings.  This should make it clearer how the various components fit
  together.  All of the concepts introduced here are described in more detail
  elsewhere in this manual.

  If it is not already on the iconbar, load a copy of CashBook by
  double-clicking on it in a filer window.  Click on CashBook's iconbar icon
  to open a new file, ready for data to be entered.


  Accounts and analysis headings
  ------------------------------

  Before any transactions can be entered, some accounts and analysis headings
  must be set up.  These are used to collect transactions together and keep
  track of money.  While the two are very similar in a number of ways, how
  they are used differs significantly.

  Accounts usually correspond to bank or building society accounts in the
  real world, as well as credit and store cards.  They can accept both
  credits and debits, and maintain a running balance which can be either
  positive (in credit) or negative (overdrawn or in debt).  Transactions in
  accounts will usually end up being matched against entries in real-world
  statements.

  Analysis headings, on the other hand, do not necessarily correspond to
  anything in the real world: they are simply labels that can be attached to
  groups of income or expenditure, such as 'Salary', 'Groceries', 'Car
  servicing', 'Pub meals' and so on.  Headings are divided into groups for
  incoming and outgoing money, and can only be used for one or the other.

  Accounts and headings are identified by both a full name and an ident: the
  latter is a short, unique name made up of up to four letters or numbers.
  The name is used by CashBook for display purposes, but for speed, entry is
  always done using the ident.  Although the idents must be unique, because
  headings can only apply to either income or expenditure, the same ident can
  be used twice.


  Adding accounts
  ---------------

  To be able to keep track of our monthly expenditure, CashBook will need to
  know about our current account.  To create the necessary account entry,
  select 'Accounts - New account...' from the menu to open the create new
  account window.

  As noted above, each account requires a name and an ident.  Since this is
  the current account, enter "Current Account" into the 'Name' field.  The
  name is for human use only, and can be as descriptive as required.

  In contrast, the ident is used for data entry: it pays to try and make them
  as memorable as possible for regularly used accounts.  Since this is the
  only current account in the file, enter "Cur" into the 'Ident' field.  The
  capitalisation is not important, although it will be remembered and used
  when displaying the entry.

  The account has an overdraft limit of £500, so enter "500" into the 'Credit
  limit' field.  At the present moment in time it is in credit to the sum of
  £250, so "250" should be entered into the 'Opening balance' field.  The
  first unused cheque in the cheque book is number 100031, so enter "100031"
  for 'Next cheque'; the account has no paying in book, so leave the 'Next
  pay-in slip' field blank.

  In the 'Bank details' section, the account number, sort code and branch
  address can be recorded.  This information is not used by CashBook, but
  provides a convenient place to store the details if required.  Once the
  necessary information has been entered, click on 'Create' to set up the
  account.

  At this point, it will not appear that much has changed.  To see the new
  account we have created, select 'Accounts - List accounts' from the main
  menu.  The accounts list window will open, showing an entry for the current
  account: notice that the statement and current balances are shown as £250,
  reflecting the opening balance, while the final balance is £750, reflecting
  the opening balance plus the overdraft limit.

  We also have a savings account, so click Menu over the accounts list window
  and select 'New account...'; this has the same effect as the entry in the
  main menu.  Enter an account name of "Savings Account" and an ident of
  "Sav".

  There is no overdraft facility, cheque book or paying in book, so 'Credit
  limit', 'Next cheque' and 'Next pay-in slip' can all be left blank;
  'Opening balance' can also be left blank as the account is brand new and
  there is no money in it yet.  Click on 'Create', and a new line should
  appear in the accounts list: all the balances are zero, and should remain
  blank.


  New analysis headings
  ---------------------

  In order to be able to acquire or spend money, some analysis headings will
  be needed in addition to the accounts.  These are added in a similar way,
  so select 'Headings - New heading...' from the main menu to open the create
  new heading window.

  First we will require a heading to represent our salary, so enter "Salary"
  in the 'Name' field and "Sal" in the 'Ident' field.  The salary is money
  coming in, so select 'Incoming'.  Unless we receive a pay rise, we expect
  to receive about £12,000 after tax this year, so enter "12000" into the
  'Budget limit'.  Click on 'Create' to add the heading.

  As with the accounts, there will be no visible sign that anything has
  changed.  Select 'Headings - List incoming' from the main menu, and the
  incoming headings list window will be displayed.  This contains an entry
  for our salary, showing a total of £0 received so far.

  We will also need somewhere to spend our hard-earned cash, so go back to
  the main menu and select 'Headings - New heading...' again.  There is a
  supermarket receipt in our wallet, so we will need an entry for Food: enter
  "Food" as both the 'Name' and 'Ident'.  As an expense, the 'Outgoing'
  option should be selected.  We reckon that we can afford to spend about
  £600 on food this year, so enter "600" into the 'Budget limit' field.
  Click on 'Create' to add the heading.

  As the food was an outgoing heading, it will not appear in the incoming
  headings list.  From the main menu, select 'Headings - List outgoing' and
  the outgoing headings list window should open; this looks very similar to
  the incoming list.  The first line should be an entry for food.

  The council have just sent next year's council tax statement, so we will
  need another heading to cover this.  Click Menu over the outgoing headings
  list window and select 'New heading...'; as with the accounts list, this
  has a similar effect to the main menu entry.

  Enter the 'Name' and 'Ident' as "Council Tax" and "CTax" respectively.
  Since the dialogue was opened from the outgoing headings list, 'Outgoing'
  is already selected (though there is no reason why this could not be
  changed to 'Incoming' if we wanted that type of heading).  The council want
  £512.40 from us this year, so enter "512.40" into the 'Budget limit' and
  click on 'Create'.  A new entry should appear in the outgoing headings
  list.


  Entering the first transaction
  ------------------------------

  Now that we have some accounts and headings to use, we can begin to enter
  transactions.  All transactions are entered into the main transactions
  window, which was the one that opened when the file was created.

  Transactions have four main pieces of information associated with them,
  which are:

   1. The date on which the transaction occurs;
   2. The location (account or heading) where the money is to be taken from;
   3. The location (account or heading) where the money is to be sent; and
   4. The amount of money which is to be transferred.

  In addition to these items, each transaction can have a reference (such as
  a cheque or invoice number) and a descriptive text to help identify the
  purpose of the transaction.

  Place the caret into the first line of the 'Date' column, by clicking there
  with the mouse.  The date on that food receipt is 27 May 2005, so enter
  "27-05-2005" and press Return to move to the next column.

  The 'From' column shows the account or heading from which the transaction
  takes money: since the food was paid for by cheque, this will be our
  current account.  Enter the ident of the current account, which is "Cur".
  As the third character is typed, the full account name should be filled in
  on the right of the column; if not, check that you entered it correctly
  both here and in the account definition.  Press Return again, to move to
  the next column.

  The 'To' column shows the account or heading to which the transaction pays
  money: in this case, it will be the food analysis heading.  Enter the ident
  "Food", and again the full name should be filled in on the right.  This
  time, an asterisk will have also appeared in the centre of the column:
  being a heading, the entry is automatically reconciled.  This will be
  described later.

  Pressing Return will move to the 'Reference' column.  We paid by cheque, so
  recording the cheque number here would be useful; since we have already
  told CashBook that the next cheque number is 100031, pressing F1 (the
  'quick entry key') will enter that here and update the next number to
  100032.

  Press Return again to move to the 'Amount' column.  The receipt shows a
  total of £18.49, so enter "18.49" here.  Press Return to move into the
  final 'Description' column: this is a free-text field that can be used to
  record more information about the transaction.  For food purchases, we
  would like to record the supermarket name, so enter "Morrisons" and press
  Return one final time to place the caret at the start of the next line.


  Updated balances
  ----------------

  Having entered the transaction for the food receipt, a quick look at the
  accounts list and outgoing headings list windows will show that things have
  changed.

  In the accounts list, the current and final balances will have decreased by
  £18.49 each (to £231.51 and £731.51 respectively), reflecting the fact that
  the money has gone from the account.  The statement balance has not
  changed, because the current account side of the transaction was not
  reconciled.  This means that the transaction has not been seen and 'ticked
  off' on a statement from our bank, so the statement balance remains at the
  original value.  The budget figure has gone to £-18.49, showing that
  overall the balance of the current account has changed by £-18.49.

  In the outgoing headings list, the total and actual balances for food have
  increased to £18.49 to indicate that this amount has been spent.  Since the
  budgeted amount was £600, the budget balance has decreased to £600-£18.49,
  or £581.51.


  Adding some more transactions
  -----------------------------

  Now that we have seen that the food transaction has been recorded
  correctly, the other transactions need to be added.  Return to the
  transactions window, and place the caret into the 'Date' column of the
  first blank line; if the caret was still in the 'Description' column from
  the food purchase, then pressing Return will do this automatically.

  When we opened that savings account, on 2 June 2005, we paid in £500 by
  cheque.  Enter the 'Date' as "2-6-2005", and the "Cur" account in the
  'From' column, pressing Return to move from column to column.  The money
  will be moving to the savings account, so "Sav" could be entered into the
  'To' column as we did before.

  However, there is another way to select accounts and analysis headings when
  the ident is hard to remember.  Click Adjust over the row with the caret,
  in the right-hand part of the 'To' column, and a menu will appear listing
  the accounts and outgoing analysis headings that can be entered: select
  'Accounts - Savings Account', and the account name will be entered as if
  the ident had been typed.  Press Return until the caret is in the
  'Reference' column, then press F1 again to enter 100032 as the cheque
  number.  Finally, enter "500" in the 'Amount' column.

  A quick check of the current account's balance in the accounts list will
  show that we are now overdrawn by £268.49.  Since our overdraft limit is
  £500, the final balance still shows as £231.51.  In fact, we were paid at
  the end of May, so this is not a problem at all.

  Back in the transactions window, place the caret in the next blank 'Date'
  field and enter "31-5-05" for the last day of May.  Pressing Return will
  move the caret to the next column, and also sort the transaction rows so
  that they appear in chronological order; using Tab to move between columns
  prevents this sorting from taking place.  Complete the remainder of the
  transaction: from "Sal", to "Cur", amount "1000".

  On checking the details in the accounts list and incoming headings list, we
  should find that we are now back in the black again.


  Adding a regular direct debit
  -----------------------------

  The only thing left to deal with is the council tax bill.  We pay this by
  direct debit, and the council have supplied a payment schedule which gives
  the dates that they will take money from our account.  Although we could
  enter these dates by hand as they become due, it will be easier to set up a
  regular payment to handle it for us; this way, payments will show up on
  forecasted balances and should never be forgotten.

  Regular payments, whatever their nature, are referred to as 'standing
  orders' in CashBook.  From the main menu, select 'Transactions - New
  Standing Order...' and the create new standing order dialogue will open.
  There are two sections to this: the first deals with WHEN the transaction
  will take place, while the second specifies WHAT the transaction contains.

  The council have informed us that we will make ten payments, on the last
  day of the month, starting on 30 April 2005 and finishing on 31 January
  2006.  The total bill is £512.40, so the first payment will be £53.40 and
  the remaining nine will each be £51.00.

  Filling in the easy fields of the dialogue box first, there are 10 payments
  so enter "10" into the 'Number' field.  The payments are to be made
  monthly, so enter "1" into the 'Every' field and set the period to
  'Months'.

  The start date is slightly less obvious.  If we were dealing with a period
  of days or years, the date would simply be the date of the first payment,
  and each subsequent payment date would be found by adding on the correct
  number of days or years.  The months period behaves slightly differently,
  however, to deal with exactly the problem we currently face.

  The date of the first payment will be 30 April, which is the last day of
  the month.  If we add on one month to that, however, we end up with 30 May:
  not the last day of May.  To get around this, when working with a payment
  period in months, it is valid to enter a start date beyond the end of the
  month: if necessary, CashBook will bring the date back into range before
  posting a payment.

  As a result, enter the date "31-04-2005" into the 'Start date' field.  This
  is clearly not a valid date, so the first payment will actually take place
  on 30 April 2005.  The NEXT payment will take place on 31 May 2005,
  however.

  Finally, the council's bank do not take money at weekends, but defer the
  payment to the Monday.  As a result, tick 'Avoid weekends' and select 'Put
  back'.  Since 30 April 2005 is a Saturday, the first payment will actually
  take place on 2 May 2005.  The date of subsequent payments will be
  calculated based on 30 April.

  Having got the dates sorted out, we can now enter the transaction details.
  In the 'From' field, enter "Cur" as the payment will be coming from our
  current account; in the 'To' field, enter "CTax" to indicate the council
  tax analysis heading.  The council have given us a payment reference of
  'CT2005147', so enter "CT2005147" into the 'Reference field'.

  The amount to be paid will depend on which payment we are on: most are
  £51.00, but the first will be £53.40.  Enter "51" in the 'Amount' field,
  then tick 'First payment' and enter "53.40" in the field next to it.
  Finally, additional information (if there is any) can be entered into the
  'Description' field, then click on 'Create' to add the standing order.

  Depending upon the date on which you follow this tutorial, a number of
  transactions will be added to the transactions window.  The first will be
  for £53.40 on 2 May 2005, then there will be further transactions for £51
  on 31 May, 30 June, 1 August and so on.  If the current date is after 31
  January 2006, all ten transactions will be added and the standing order
  will end up 'stopped'.

  Selecting 'Transactions - List standing orders' from the main menu will
  open the standing orders list window.  This should contain an entry for the
  council tax payments, showing the accounts and headings concerned, the
  standard amount to be transferred and the description.  The 'Next date'
  column shows the actual date of the next transaction, or "Stopped", and
  'Left' shows how many transactions are still to be carried out.

  With hindsight, it would have been more appropriate to have entered our
  salary payments as a standing order as well: these should be fixed to the
  final day of each month.  In general, any transactions which occur at
  regular intervals are best packaged as standing orders; details of the
  transaction, such as amounts of money, can always be edited either in the
  standing order definition or in the resulting transactions if necessary.


  Seeing an account 'statement'
  -----------------------------

  Before moving on to look at the operation of CashBook in detail, it would
  be useful to see the transactions in our current account listed together in
  the form of a 'bank statement'.  If nothing else, this would let us see how
  the balance varies over time.

  From the main menu, select 'Accounts - View account - Current account' to
  open the current account transactions window.  It contains all the
  transactions which reference the current account, but does so in the form
  of payments and receipts and including a running balance.  The order in
  which transactions appear here is the order in which they are sorted: this
  may not correspond to the order your bank sees them in, and may result in
  variations between the balances at given points.

  Double-clicking on a field in the current account transactions window will
  place the caret in the corresponding field in the transactions window;
  using Adjust also brings the transactions window to the front.



Accounts and Analysis Headings
------------------------------

  A CashBook file consists of a series of transactions, which move money from
  one location to another.  These locations can either be accounts, or
  analysis headings.  While the two are similar in many ways, they are used
  for distinct purposes.

  Accounts correspond to accounts in real life, such as current accounts,
  savings accounts, loose change or credit and store cards.  They can have
  money moved in or out, and they have balances associated with them,
  indicating how much money is available at different times.  Depending upon
  the type of account being represented, there may also be a credit limit or
  overdraft specified.

  Analysis headings are split into two groups to handle all income and
  expenditure, such as wages, bank interest, or money spent on food, petrol
  or home insurance.  Each heading can have a budget target set for it,
  allowing income and spending to be monitored over time.  It pays to
  carefully consider the headings that are used when setting up a cashbook
  file, as it can make tracking your money a lot easier.


  Creating new accounts
  ---------------------

  New accounts can be created through the create new account dialogue, either
  by selecting 'Accounts - New account...' from the main menu or by clicking
  on the 'new account' button in the transaction window toolbar.

  Every account must have a name and an ident associated with it.  The name
  is used to identify the account on screen and in reports, and can be
  anything that identifies the account: for example, 'Current account',
  'Savings account', 'Credit card' or 'Cash in hand'.  CashBook never uses
  the name internally, so it can safely be changed at any point without
  affecting data stored, should this be necessary.

  The ident is a short textual 'tag' of up to four characters used to
  identify the account when entering transactions or referring to the account
  in dialogue boxes.  It can contain any letters of numbers and although case
  is preserved when displaying it on screen, it is ignored when looking for a
  matching account (so "Sav1" and "sav1" would both be seen as the same).
  Since idents are used for entering data, it is worth using ones that you
  can remember.  As with the account name, an ident can safely be changed at
  any point after the account has been created.

  The name and ident are the only pieces of information required to create an
  account, although additional details may be specified depending on the type
  of account being represented.  Left blank, the additional details will
  default to sensible values that will apply to many situations.

  The 'Credit limit' field is used to specify a credit limit on a credit
  card, an overdraft limit on an account or any similar item.  In each case,
  the amount is entered as a positive value and indicates how far the account
  balance can be taken below zero.

  The 'Opening balance' field gives the initial balance in the account and is
  used to calculate the current balance from.  If the account was opened
  during the period that the cashbook file covers, the opening balance is
  optional and the same effect can be achieved by entering a transaction for
  the initial amount; indeed, this may be preferable, as it shows where the
  money came from.  If the account was open before the file period begins,
  however, the opening balance provides an easy way of bridging the gap.

  If the account comes with a paying in book, the 'Next pay-in slip' field
  allows the number of the next paying-in slip to be recorded.  If F1 is
  pressed in the 'Reference' column when entering a transaction TO this
  account, the current number will be inserted and the number stored will be
  incremented ready for the next slip.

  In a similar way, if the account comes with a cheque book then the 'Next
  cheque' field allows the number of the next cheque to be recorded and used
  when transactions are entered FROM this account.

  Finally, the 'Bank details' section provides a means of recording
  information about the account.  All the fields are plain text and can be
  used as required.

  Clicking on 'Create' will check the details and create an account; if the
  ident is not unique, a warning will be generated and it must be changed.
  Once created, the account will appear in all the account lists and can be
  used in transactions.


  Creating new analysis headings
  ------------------------------

  In a similar way to accounts, new analysis headings are created through the
  create new heading dialogue, either by selecting 'Headings - New
  heading...' from the main menu or by clicking on the 'new heading' button
  in the transaction window toolbar.

  As with accounts, every heading must have a name and an ident associated
  with it.  The name is used to identify the heading on screen and in
  reports, and can be anything that identifies the heading's purpose: for
  example, 'Salary', 'Bank interest', 'Food', or 'Car insurance'.  CashBook
  never uses the name internally, so it can safely be changed at any point
  without affecting data stored, should this be necessary.

  The ident is a short textual 'tag' of up to four characters used to
  identify the heading when entering transactions or referring to the account
  in dialogue boxes.  It can contain any letters of numbers and although case
  is preserved when displaying it on screen, it is ignored when looking for a
  matching heading (so "Food" and "food" would both be seen as the same).
  Selecting memorable idents can help speed up data entry.  As with the
  heading name, an ident can safely be changed at any point after the heading
  has been created.

  When created, each heading can be specified as being either 'Incoming' or
  'Outgoing', depending on whether it will be used in the 'From' or 'To'
  fields of transactions.  Once created, the type of a heading can not be
  changed, but it is possible to create incoming and outgoing headings with
  the same name and ident if necessary.

  The 'Budget limit' is optional, and is used in connection with the current
  budget period.  The value is a target amount to be spent or received during
  the period, and if set, it is reported in the heading list window along
  with the actual amount spent and the difference.

  Clicking on 'Create' will check the details and create a heading; if the
  ident is not unique, a warning will be generated and it must be changed;
  the available idents are also shared with any accounts defined in the file.
  Once created, the heading will appear in the relevant heading list and can
  be used in transactions.


  Checking account and analysis heading details
  ---------------------------------------------

  All of the accounts and analysis headings in a cashbook file are shown in
  one of three windows.  Accounts appear in the accounts list window, while
  analysis headings appear in either the incoming headings list window or
  outgoing headings list window.

  The accounts list window can be opened from the main menu with 'Accounts -
  List accounts', by clicking on the 'list accounts' button in the
  transaction window toolbar or by pressing F9.  Each account is displayed on
  its own line, with balance and cashflow figures.

  The 'Statement' balance is the reconciled balance of the account, taking
  into account only those transactions that have been reconciled with entries
  in account statements.  If there are no errors, this should be the same as
  the final balance on the last statement received, helping to show up
  errors.

  The 'Current' balance takes into account all transactions, reconciled or
  not, up to and including the current date as given by the computer's clock.
  This gives a reasonable indication of the balance in the account NOW, but
  remember that it does not allow for time taken by banks to process
  payments.

  The 'Final' balance is the balance of the account at some point in the
  future, taking into account the information on future transactions
  available to CashBook.  Any post-dated transactions are included, subject
  to limits set in the budget details, and future standing orders are also
  included according to the budget rules.  Any overdraft or credit limit set
  for the account is added to the value, showing the total amount of money
  available for use.

  Finally, the 'Budget' column shows the overall change in the account
  balance during the current budget period, including all transactions.  This
  can give an indication of the trend in the account balance, but the
  condition of the account at the start of the period needs to be borne in
  mind.

  For analysis headings, the incoming headings list windows can be opened
  from the main menu with 'Headings - List incoming', by clicking on the
  'list incoming headings' button in the transaction window toolbar or by
  pressing F10.  The outgoing headings list window can be opened from the
  main menu with 'Headings - List outgoing', by clicking on the 'list
  outgoing headings' button in the transaction window toolbar or by pressing
  F11.

  Each analysis heading has a 'Total' shown, which is the total amount
  received or spent against that heading when taking into account all the
  transactions in the file.  Because headings will not generally relate to
  external accounts, there is no distinction made between reconciled and
  unreconciled transactions when calculating this total.

  The 'Budget' column shows the budget limit set for each heading. 'Actual'
  is the total amount received or spent against that heading during the
  current budget period, while 'Balance' shows the difference between the
  two.  For incoming headings, a negative balance indicates that more money
  needs to be received to meet the budget target, while for outgoing headings
  it indicates that more money has been spent than was budgeted for.

  The contents of the accounts list and headings list windows can be exported
  as a CSV or TSV file, for importing into spreadsheets or wordprocessors,
  using the 'Export CSV' and 'Export TSV' options from their respective
  menus.

  The windows can also be printed, by selecting 'Print...' from the menu or
  clicking on the 'print' button in the toolbar.  The standard printing
  options are available, and the entire list of accounts or analysis headings
  will be printed.


  Grouping accounts or analysis headings together
  -----------------------------------------------

  As new accounts or analysis headers are created, they are added to the end
  of the relevant list in the accounts or headings list window.  The order of
  the lists can be changed, by dragging the lines around as required.

  The list can be broken up by adding header and footer lines between the
  entries.  Headers allow sections to be given titles, while footers show a
  sub-total for each of the columns.  The sub-totals are calculated from the
  previous header line down, allowing more than one set of totals in a
  section if required.  Headers appear as dark grey title bars across the
  list, while footers are a paler grey.

  To add a new header or footer, click Menu over the window and select 'New
  section...', or click on the 'add new section' button on the toolbar to
  open the create new section dialogue.

  Section lines can be given a title, using the 'Title' field, which will be
  shown in the name column.  The lines can be created as either a 'Header' or
  a 'Footer'.  Clicking on 'Create' will add the new section headers or
  footers at the bottom of the window; it can then be dragged around as
  required.


  Highlighting overdrawn accounts or missed budget targets
  --------------------------------------------------------

  Entries in the accounts or headings list windows can be highlighted if they
  go overdrawn or fail to meet their budget targets.  This can make it easier
  to see at a glance where any problems lie.

  In the accounts list window, the values in the 'Statement' and 'Current'
  columns will be highlighted if they fall below the overdraft limit for the
  account in question.  In the 'Final' column, which takes the overdraft into
  account as part of the value displayed, entries will be highlighted if they
  fall below zero.

  In the outgoing headings list, the values in the 'Actual' and 'Balance'
  columns are highlighted if the amount spent in the budget period goes above
  the limit.  Correspondingly, in the incoming headings list, the entries
  will be highlighted if the income fails to reach the budgeted target.

  The highlighting can be turned on or off from the 'Accounts' section of the
  choices dialogue using the 'Highlight overdrawn balances' switch.  The
  colour used for the highlighting can also be set here.


  Editing and deleting accounts, headings or sections
  ---------------------------------------------------

  To edit the details of an account in the accounts list window, click Menu
  over it and select 'Edit account...'; to edit a section header or footer,
  select 'Edit section...' instead.  In both cases, double-clicking Adjust
  over the line has the same effect.

  Editing analysis headings from either of the two headings list windows is
  started in a similar manner, by clicking Menu over the entry and selecting
  'Edit heading...' or by double-clicking Adjust.

  The resulting edit dialogues allow the details of the account, analysis
  heading or section to be altered, or the entire item to be deleted.  While
  it is always possible to delete sections, accounts and analysis headings
  can not be deleted if they are used in any transactions, standing orders or
  transaction presets.  If an account or heading can not be deleted, it is
  possible to find the transactions responsible by looking at its statement
  view; to identify the standing orders or presets, it will be necessary to
  check the standing orders list and preset list windows.


  Statement views
  ---------------

  A statement view brings together all the transactions associated with an
  account or analysis heading and presents them in the format of a bank
  statement.  The details shown are transaction date, the other account or
  heading, reconciled status, reference, payment or receipt and the
  description.

  To open a statement view for an account or analysis heading, double-click
  Select on the entry in the accounts list or headings list window.  Clicking
  Menu over the line and selecting 'View account...' or 'View heading...' has
  the same effect.  For accounts, statement views can be opened from the main
  menu using 'Accounts - View account -'; this menu is also available by
  clicking on the 'view account' button in the transaction window toolbar.

  With a view open, the account or heading shown can be edited by selecting
  'Edit account...' or 'Edit heading...' from the statement view menu, or by
  clicking on the 'edit' button in the statement view toolbar.

  The reconciled status shown in the 'From/To' column of the window is for
  the transaction in the account or heading being viewed, NOT the one shown
  in the column.  In effect, it applies to the account not shown in the
  column (that is, the account which the statement view is for), which is the
  opposite of the behaviour in the transaction window and elsewhere in
  CashBook.  Transactions showing as reconciled here should appear on a
  printed statement from the relevant bank, building society, card issuer or
  whatever.

  Clicking Adjust over the reconciled field will toggle the state, in the
  same way as in the transaction window.  This is the only piece of
  information that can be changed through the statement view.

  The entries in the window are sorted according to the contents of one of
  the columns, as shown by the presence of the sort indicator arrow in the
  corresponding column heading.  The sort order can be changed by clicking
  Select or Adjust in any of the headings, to sort that column into ascending
  or descending order respectively.

  Alternatively, the sorting options can be changed from the sort account
  entries dialogue, which can be opened by clicking Select on the 'sort'
  button in the statement view toolbar or by selecting 'Sort entries...' from
  the menu.  After the options have been changed, clicking on 'Sort' will
  update the display.

  If the option to automatically sort the transactions is selected in the
  global choices, the window's contents will update if Return is pressed in
  the corresponding column of the transaction window.  At other times, an
  Adjust click on the 'sort' button in the toolbar will force a re-sort.

  The contents of the statement view can be exported as a CSV or TSV file,
  for importing into spreadsheets or wordprocessors, using the 'Export CSV'
  and 'Export TSV' options from the statement window menu.

  The window can also be printed, by selecting 'Print...' from the menu or
  clicking on the 'print' button in the toolbar.  A range of dates can be
  specified, to limit the entries printed; leaving either field blank allows
  the transactions before or after a date to be included.


  Highlighting transactions in a statement view
  ---------------------------------------------

  In the statement view for an account, it is possible to highlight
  transactions where the balance falls below the overdraft limit.  This
  option can be controlled from the 'Accounts' section of the choices
  dialogue, by toggling 'Highlight overdrawn account entries'.

  In views for analysis headings, transactions that fall outside the current
  budget range can be highlighted or shaded in a similar way, so that entries
  applying to the current budget stand out more clearly.  The 'Highlight
  heading entries outside budget' option in the choices dialogue controls
  this option.

  In both cases, the colour used to highlight entries can be specified.  This
  should be set depending on whether highlighted entries are required to
  stand out or not.


  Moving around transactions from a statement view
  ------------------------------------------------

  To locate a transaction from the statement view in the transaction window
  for editing, click Menu over it and select 'Find transaction' or
  double-click Select over it.  The transaction will be located, and the
  caret placed within it (either in the 'Date' field or in the field
  corresponding to the one double-clicked over).  Double-clicking with Adjust
  has the same effect, but the transaction window is brought to the top of
  the window stack so that it is fully visible.

  Moving the other way, selecting 'Goto transaction' from the statement view
  menu or clicking on the 'goto transaction' button in the statement view
  toolbar will scroll the view so that the transaction in the transaction
  window that contains the caret is shown (assuming that it is in the
  statement view at all).



Transactions
------------

  Transactions are central to CashBook, as they allow the movement money
  between accounts and analysis headings.  A transaction moving money from an
  account to an analysis heading is a 'payment', while one that moves money
  from a heading to an account is a 'receipt'.  Transfers between two
  accounts can also be achieved in the same way.

  The transaction window is central to a CashBook file, and acts as a focus
  around which all the other windows are located; if the window is closed,
  all the associated windows will also close and the file is removed from
  memory (after a warning if the data is unsaved, of course).  It contains a
  full list of all the transactions in the file, and is the place where new
  transactions are added and existing ones edited.

  The transactions in the window are sorted according to the contents of one
  of the columns, as shown by the presence of the sort indicator arrow in the
  corresponding column heading.  The sort order can be changed by clicking
  Select or Adjust in any of the headings, to sort that column into ascending
  or descending order respectively.

  Alternatively, the sorting options can be changed from the sort
  transactions dialogue, which can be opened by clicking Select on the 'sort'
  button in the transaction window toolbar, by selecting 'Transactions -
  Sort...' from the menu, or by pressing F5.  After the options have been
  changed, clicking on 'Sort' will update the display.

  If the option to automatically sort the transactions is selected in the
  global choices, the window's contents will update if Return is pressed in
  the sorted column.  At other times, an Adjust click on the 'sort' button in
  the toolbar will force a re-sort.

  Transactions can be exported as a CSV or TSV file, for importing into
  spreadsheets or wordprocessors, using the 'File - Export CSV' and 'File -
  Export TSV' options from the menu.

  The contents of the window can also be printed, by selecting 'File -
  Print...' from the menu, clicking on the 'print' button in the toolbar or
  pressing Print.  A range of dates can be specified, to limit the
  transactions printed; leaving either field blank allows the transactions
  before or after a date to be included.


  What is a transaction?
  ----------------------

  A transaction consists of the information required to move money from one
  location to another.  It can move money between accounts, from accounts to
  analysis headings or from analysis headings to accounts.  Entries consist
  of up to six pieces of information, as follows:

  * The 'Date' shows when the transaction occurred, and may be any date from
    the year 100 to the year 9999.  The date is used to sort transactions for
    analysis and budgeting, and allows post-dated entries (those with dates
    ahead of the current date from the computer's clock) to be identified.

  * The 'From' field shows the account or heading from which the money will
    be taken.  If you are making a payment from an account, that account will
    go here; otherwise, a heading corresponding to the source of the money
    (such as 'Wages' or 'Bank interest') or another account from which the
    money is being transferred will be entered.

  * The 'To' field shows the account or heading to which the money will be
    paid.  If you are making a payment to an account (such as 'Savings
    account' or 'Credit card'), that account will go here; otherwise, a
    heading corresponding to the recipient of the money (for example 'Food'
    or 'Petrol') or another account will be entered.

  * The 'Reference' is a 12 character reference, which is available for use
    as required.  It can contain anything at all, from a cheque number (which
    CashBook can automate) or invoice number, to something like the mileage
    on a car when fuel was purchased.

  * The 'Amount' is the amount of money that the transaction is for.  It will
    be debited from the account or heading in the 'From' column and credited
    to the one in the 'To' column.

  * The 'Description' is a free-text field of up to 100 characters, that can
    be used to supply more information about the transaction.  No
    significance is placed on the contents, but they can be searched if
    required and are made available when generating some types of report.

  The from and to fields both have a reconciled flag, which can be set to
  indicate that the entry has been checked against a bank, building society
  or credit card statement.  When the field refers to an account, the flag is
  initially unset; for analysis headings, the flag is always set and has no
  meaning.


  Entering transactions
  ---------------------

  The transaction window is a lot like a spreadsheet, with rows containing
  individual transactions and columns to represent the various fields in
  them.  Data is entered by typing directly into the cells: new entries can
  be made into blank cells, and existing details can be edited in the usual
  way.

  To place the caret in a cell, click Select over it.  The Left and Right
  cursor keys move the caret backwards and forwards in the cell.  The Up and
  Down keys move up and down the rows, while Tab and Shift-tab move right and
  left from cell to cell.  Pressing Return will also move the caret to the
  next cell (like Tab), but may also have additional effects: in the
  currently sorted column, it will cause the transaction to be sorted into
  the correct place, while in the 'Description' column, it will place the
  caret in the next blank line.

  The Page up, Page down, Home and End keys behave in the standard way.
  Scrolling the window down below the last line, using either Down or the
  down tool on the scroll bar, will add blank lines to the end of the window.

  In general, transaction details are entered directly into the columns;
  dates are entered in the "DD-MM-YYYY" format.  The 'From' and 'To' columns
  are slightly different, as they consist of three cells: from left to right,
  these contain the account or heading ident, the reconciled flag, and the
  full name of the account or heading.  The caret can only be placed into the
  ident area, and the other two sections will update depending upon the
  account or analysis heading ident which is entered here.

  As an alternative to remembering and typing in the idents for all accounts
  and headings, clicking Adjust over the name field of the 'From' and 'To'
  columns will open a menu containing all the options that can be entered.
  This is split into two sections, with accounts in submenus at the top and
  analysis headings at the bottom.  If the accounts or headings lists have
  been grouped using header rows in their respective list windows, then the
  submenus will reflect those groupings.

  Each transaction can be reconciled against both the 'From' and 'To'
  accounts, and reconciled entries are indicated by a asterisk in the correct
  column.  With the caret in the ident field, the + and - keys set and unset
  the reconciled status; clicking Adjust over the field will toggle its
  state.


  Speeding up data entry
  ----------------------

  Entering the transaction details can be speeded up for some of the fields
  by using the F1 'quick entry key' to fill in standard default information.
  How this behaves depends on the column which currently contains the caret,
  as follows:

  * In the 'Date' column, pressing F1 will insert the current day's date,
    overwriting whatever was present before.  Alternatively, click Adjust
    over the column, and select 'Today's date' from the shortcut menu.

  * In the 'Reference' column, F1 will insert the next cheque or pay-in slip
    number, depending upon the accounts given in the 'From' and 'To' columns.
    Alternatively, click Adjust over the column, and select 'Pay-in or
    cheque' from the shortcut menu.

    If the 'From' column contains an account with a cheque number specified,
    the next number will be inserted from that sequence; similarly, if the
    'To' column contains an account with a pay-in slip number specified, that
    will be used.  If both columns contain accounts with the respective
    numbers set, a prompt will ask which to use.

    The Adjust-click menu also contains a list of other references used in
    the file, which can be selected to enter them into the field.  If the
    field already contains some text, only other references starting with the
    same characters will be included.

  * In the 'Description' column, the entry will be completed by pressing F1.
    If some text is already in the field, the last entry starting with that
    string is copied down (the match is case-insensitive, but the case of the
    copied text is preserved).  If the field was blank, the last text found
    is copied.

    Clicking Adjust over the column opens a menu containing a list of other
    descriptions used in the file, from which one can be selected to insert
    it into the field.  If the field already contains some text, only other
    descriptions starting with the same characters will be included.

  In addition, when moving on to the next field, holding down Ctrl while
  pressing Return or Tab (ie.  Ctrl-Return or Ctrl-Tab) will copy the
  contents of the transaction above into the field.


  Transaction presets
  -------------------

  Sometimes there will be transactions, or bits of transactions, which are
  used frequently, but not regularly enough to be candidates for standing
  orders (as described in the next chapter).  In such cases, transaction
  presets may be of use.

  Presets are effectively transaction templates, where some or all of the
  fields are completed and stored for future use.  While all of the columns
  in the transaction window can be specified in a preset, often some will be
  left blank to be filled in each time the preset is used.

  New presets are created using the create new preset dialogue, either by
  selecting 'Transactions - New preset...' from the main menu, or by clicking
  on the 'new transaction preset' button in the transaction window toolbar.

  Each preset must be given a unique 'Name' to identify it, and it can also
  be allocated a 'Shortcut key'.  The key is a single letter (A to Z), which
  can be pressed while the caret is in the 'Date' column of the transaction
  window to insert the contents of the preset into the current transaction;
  without a key, presets can be accessed from a menu.

  The fields in the 'Details' section contain the normal transaction details:
  if a field is left blank, the preset will not update that column of the
  transaction window when inserted into a transaction.  If 'Today' is ticked,
  the current date (at the time the preset is used) will be inserted into the
  'Date' column; if 'Pay-in or cheque' is ticked, the 'Reference' column will
  be set to the next appropriate pay-in slip or cheque number for the
  accounts given in the 'From' and 'To' columns at the time (as if F1 was
  pressed in each case).

  The column of radio icons to the right of the dialogue allows the final
  destination of the caret to be set: this allows the caret to be placed
  appropriately for filling in any fields left blank in the preset.  Clicking
  on 'Create' will add the preset to the file.

  To insert a preset, either click Adjust over the 'Date' column of the
  transaction window and select its name from the list, or press its shortcut
  key while the caret is in the 'Date' column.  Pressing a shortcut key
  behaves as if Return was pressed.  If the 'Date' field in the preset is
  left empty, this allows all of the auto-completion options to be used with
  dates when entering presets.

  The presets defined in a file can be seen in the transaction preset list
  window, which can be opened by selecting 'Transactions - List presets' from
  the main menu or by clicking on the 'list transaction presets' button in
  the transaction toolbar.

  Each line in the window lists a preset.  The 'Name' and 'Key' columns show
  their names and shortcut keys (where defined), while the 'From', 'To',
  'Amount' and 'Description' columns show some of the details.
  Double-clicking on an entry will allow it to be viewed in full, edited, or
  deleted.

  The presets in the window are sorted according to the contents of one of
  the columns, as shown by the presence of the sort indicator arrow in the
  corresponding column heading.  The sort order can be changed by clicking
  Select or Adjust in any of the headings, to sort that column into ascending
  or descending order respectively.

  Alternatively, the sorting options can be changed from the sort presets
  dialogue, which can be opened by clicking Select on the 'sort' button in
  the transaction presets list toolbar or by selecting 'Sort entries...' from
  the menu.  After the options have been changed, clicking on 'Sort' will
  update the display.

  If the option to automatically sort the preset list is selected in the
  global choices, the window's contents will update as presets are added or
  updated.  At other times, an Adjust click on the 'sort' button in the
  toolbar will force a re-sort.

  The list of presets can be exported as a CSV or TSV file, for importing
  into spreadsheets or wordprocessors, using the 'Export CSV' and 'Export
  TSV' options from the presets list menu.  The contents of the window can
  also be printed, by selecting 'Print...' from the menu or clicking on the
  'print' button in the toolbar.  The full list of presets will be printed,
  as shown in the window.


  Reconciling entries
  -------------------

  One of the most important functions of any accounting software is to allow
  account statements from banks, building societies, credit card companies
  and so on to be checked off against the transaction record to make sure
  that they are correct.  Incorrect entries need to be highlighted, to allow
  them to be investigated and errors rectified.

  The approach that CashBook uses is to allow the 'From' and 'To' fields of
  each transaction to be marked as reconciled once they have been checked off
  against a statement.  Reconciled items show up with an asterisk in the
  centre field of the relevant column, and are included in the statement
  balance of the account in question.  When all of the entries on the new
  statement have been checked and reconciled, the statement balance in
  CashBook should agree with the final balance on the statement.

  Each transaction has two separate reconciled markers, for the 'From' and
  'To' accounts, since transactions between accounts can apply to two
  different statements.  Headings also have reconciled markers, but these are
  set automatically and are ignored when calculations are carried out.  Once
  both fields in a transaction have been reconciled, the line can be
  highlighted (or greyed out) in the transaction window.

  When the caret is in either the 'From' or 'To' column, the reconciled
  status can be changed by pressing + (or =) to set the marker or - to unset
  it.  Alternatively, clicking Adjust over the marker will toggle its state.

  When reconciling the transactions contained in a statement, it is possible
  to simply find each entry in the transaction window and check it off.
  However, there are two ways in which the process can be made easier.

   1. If 'Reconcile Mode' is turned on, either by selecting 'Transactions -
      Reconcile' from the main menu or by toggling the 'reconcile' icon in
      the transaction window toolbar, pressing either + or - will update the
      status of the flag as normal.  Having done this, the account at the
      caret is checked, and the caret moved on to the next unreconciled entry
      concerning it.

      Once the reconciliation is complete, the Reconcile Mode can be turned
      off again, by toggling the toolbar icon or un-ticking the menu entry.

   2. As an alternative, a statement view can be opened for the account to be
      reconciled.  This option allows the statement to be worked through in
      the order that it appears on paper.  The reconciled fields in the
      statement view can also be toggled with Adjust

  The Find transaction window can be used to locate the first unreconciled
  transaction for a given account, by entering that account unreconciled in
  both the 'From' and 'To' fields.

  When viewing the account details in the accounts list window, the
  reconciled balances for each account are shown under the 'Statement'
  column.  In each case, this should correspond to the final balance shown on
  the most recent reconciled statement for that account; if not, there is a
  discrepancy between the data in CashBook and the information held by the
  bank.

  Transactions where both the 'From' and 'To' fields are reconciled can be
  shown highlighted or shaded in the transaction window if required.  This
  makes it easier to spot transactions which still need to be checked against
  a bank or card statement.  The option can be set and the highlight colour
  changed from the 'Transactions' section of the choices dialogue.

  An unreconciled transaction report can be generated by selecting 'Analysis
  - Unreconciled report...' from the main menu: this will list unreconciled
  transactions meeting certain criteria.  More details can be found in the
  Reporting and Analysis chapter.


  Deleting transactions
  ---------------------

  It will not normally be necessary to delete transactions from a file, but
  under some circumstances it may be needed.  It is possible to delete an
  entry column by column, clearing the contents of each cell in turn with
  Delete, Ctrl-U or (if the clipboard is enabled) Ctrl-X.  However, there is
  also a facility to delete an entire line in one go, by pressing Ctrl-F10
  when the caret is in the required transaction.

  Since this operation could potentially be unwelcome, there is an option to
  disable it.  This can be set from the 'Transactions' section of the choices
  dialogue.



Standing Orders and Repeating Transactions
------------------------------------------

  Through the use of Standing Orders, CashBook can automatically enter
  regularly recurring transactions such as salary payments, direct debits
  and, of course, standing orders.  Each standing order definition describes
  a transaction which is repeated a given number of times (from once to 999
  times) with a specified interval.

  Transactions entered automatically can have all of the same information
  attached as manually entered ones.  In addition, it is possible to specify
  different amounts for the first or last transaction in the sequence: this
  can be used to take account of the common situation where a series of
  standing orders or direct debits start or finish with a different payment.


  Creating a new standing order
  -----------------------------

  New standing orders can be created using the create new standing order
  dialogue, either by selecting 'Transactions - New standing order...' from
  the main menu, or by clicking on the 'new standing order' button in the
  transaction window toolbar.

  The contents of the dialogue box can be split into two sections: at the
  top, information is entered to show when the transactions will occur, while
  at the bottom, the actual details of the transaction are given.

  Enter the date of the first transaction and the number of transactions that
  are to be made in the 'Start date' and 'Number' fields.  The start date
  given is used as a target, and depending upon the other settings, the
  actual date of the first transaction may differ.

  The period between transactions is entered in the 'Every' field, with the
  unit selected after it.  Days and years will operate as expected, with each
  new transaction date being calculated exactly from the previous one.  The
  exception to this is if the date is set to 29th February of a leap year,
  with a period of years: in non-leap years, the transaction will occur on
  28th February.

  If months are selected, however, things are slightly different.  The day of
  the month for the start date can be entered as any between 1 and 31
  inclusive, regardless of the actual number of days in the given month.  In
  the event of the current month having less days than the date specified,
  the transaction is brought forward to the last real day.  This allows a
  direct debit to be set to be paid on the last day of every month, by
  setting the start date to be the 31st day.

  'Avoid weekends' allows the transactions to avoid being paid at weekends
  when the banks are closed.  Once a target date is found for the
  transaction, the date will be stepped forwards or backwards until a weekday
  is chosen.  Despite this, the ORIGINAL target date (prior to a weekday
  being found) is used to add the offset to for the next payment.

  In the 'Details' section below, enter the transaction details as for a
  normal transaction.  Sometimes direct debits require a different amount to
  be paid on the first or last instalment; if this is the case, enter the
  usual amount in the 'Amount' field and use the 'First payment' and 'Last
  payment' fields as necessary.

  Clicking on 'Create' will add the new standing order to the list.  If the
  start date falls before the current date, transactions will be added
  immediately to bring the date of the next transaction into the future: in
  extreme cases, this may result in the standing order being completed
  immediately.


  Viewing standing orders
  -----------------------

  A complete list of the standing orders that are defined in a file can be
  seen in the standing orders list window, which can be opened by selecting
  'Transactions - List standing orders' from the main menu or by clicking on
  the 'list standing orders' button in the transaction window toolbar.

  Each line in the window shows details of a single standing order.  The
  'From', 'To', 'Amount' and 'Description' columns show the transaction
  details as they will be entered into the accounts.  The amount shown is
  always the standard amount, even if the next transaction will be the first
  or last in the sequence.

  The 'Next date' is the date on which the next transaction will be entered.
  This is the calculated date, and takes into account details such as shorter
  months, weekend avoidance and so on.  If the standing order is complete or
  has been stopped, this will show as 'Stopped'.

  The 'Left' column shows how many transactions are still to be carried out.
  This counts down from the initial number, and will show zero if the order
  is complete or has been stopped.

  The orders in the window are sorted according to the contents of one of the
  columns, as shown by the presence of the sort indicator arrow in the
  corresponding column heading.  The sort order can be changed by clicking
  Select or Adjust in any of the headings, to sort that column into ascending
  or descending order respectively.

  Alternatively, the sorting options can be changed from the sort standing
  orders dialogue, which can be opened by clicking Select on the 'sort'
  button in the standing orders list toolbar or by selecting 'Sort
  entries...' from the menu.  After the options have been changed, clicking
  on 'Sort' will update the display.

  If the option to automatically sort the standing order list is selected in
  the global choices, the window's contents will update as orders are added
  or updated, or as the associated transactions are added to the file.  At
  other times, an Adjust click on the 'sort' button in the toolbar will force
  a re-sort.  Automatic sorting can be used on the 'Next date' column to
  ensure that the next standing order to occur is always shown at the top of
  the list.

  The list of standing orders can be exported as a CSV or TSV file, for
  importing into spreadsheets or wordprocessors, using the 'Export CSV' and
  'Export TSV' options from the standing orders list menu.

  The contents of the window can also be printed, by selecting 'Print...'
  from the menu or clicking on the 'print' button in the toolbar.  The full
  list of standing orders will be printed, as shown in the window.
  Alternatively, the standing order report can be opened by selecting 'Full
  report' from the menu: this gives complete details of each order in the
  form of a list.


  Editing and stopping standing orders
  ------------------------------------

  Once a standing order has been created, it is possible to change some of
  the details, or stop it before it is complete.  These actions are carried
  out through the Edit standing order details dialogue, which can be opened
  by double-clicking over a line in the standing orders list window or by
  clicking Menu over it and selecting 'Edit standing order...'.

  Any of the details of the standing order can be edited, although if it is
  currently in progress the start date and period can not be changed.  The
  number of transactions can always be adjusted, but if the order is in
  progress the number must remain greater than those that have already taken
  place.

  To store any changes that have been made, click 'Update'; clicking 'Cancel'
  will lose any changes that have been made since they were last stored.

  A standing order can be stopped by clicking on 'Stop'.  This will cause the
  remaining transactions to be set to zero, and allows the start date and
  period to be altered.  Stopped orders can be left in the list for future
  use; if 'Delete' is used, on the other hand, the details are removed from
  the file.



Budgeting
---------

  Two facilities are provided by CashBook for tracking and analysing income,
  spending and cashflow.  Budgeting, which is described in this chapter,
  continually monitors the money going into and out of analysis headings, as
  well as keeping an eye on the flow of money through accounts.  In contrast,
  the Reporting and Analysis facilities can provide much more detailed
  information, but do so as a snapshot taken at a particular instance in
  time.

  Budgeting allows targets to be set for income and expenditure over a period
  of time, then compares these to what actually happens.  The process makes
  use of analysis headings, with the option to set a budget limit for each
  heading.


  Setting up a budget
  -------------------

  To set up a budget, two pieces of information need to be decided: the
  period over which the budget is to run, and the amount of money available
  to be spent in that period.  Once these have been established, it is
  possible to allocate the available funds across the known areas of
  expenditure.

  By default, a CashBook budget will run for the duration of the whole file
  and include all of the transactions.  This makes sense if a new file is
  started at the beginning of each financial period; if not, the budget
  period can be restricted to a given set of dates.  Open the budget details
  dialogue by selecting 'Analysis - Budget...' from the main menu, and enter
  the dates into the 'Budgeting dates' section.

  Allocating the expenditure is done through individual analysis headings.
  Each heading can have a budget limit set in the edit heading details
  dialogue, which shows up in the 'Budget' column of the headings list
  window.  If this value is non-zero, the field in the 'Actual' column will
  show how much has been spent against that heading during the budget period
  (if there is no period set, this value will be the same as the one in
  'Total'). 'Balance' indicates how much of the budget amount is left (ie.
  Balance = Budget - Actual).

  The layout of the headings list windows means that printing them or
  exporting them to another application provides a useful budget sheet
  showing budgeted amounts and actual expenditure.  Budget limits can be
  revised at any point, and the various calculations will update
  automatically.

  Similar budgeting facilities are available on incoming headings, although
  it may be harder to budget for many types of income.  Once set up, the
  difference between the grand totals for the incoming and outgoing 'Budget'
  columns should show the targeted gain or loss over the period, while the
  same difference for the 'Actual' columns shows the actual performance.


  Budgeting with accounts
  -----------------------

  In the accounts list window, the 'Budget' column shows the change in
  balance of each account during the budget period, by adding up all credits
  and debits that fall in the date range.  This has no direct connection with
  the budgets set up for analysis headings, but in the case of savings
  accounts can provide a limited indication of the amount of money put away
  (or, indeed, withdrawn) during the period.

  The value should be treated with caution, as it can easily be affected by
  the starting condition of the accounts.  For example, if the budget period
  coincided with the tax year and money was held in a current account ready
  to be transferred to a savings account at the start of the new year, that
  current account would be likely to show a large negative 'Budget' value for
  most of the budget period as the balance started high and an unusually
  large amount was quickly withdrawn.

  While the account budget indication can be useful as a quick guide, for
  more detailed analysis of this kind of information the reporting and
  analysis features may be more appropriate.


  Monitoring post-dated transactions
  ----------------------------------

  In addition to analysing income and expenditure, CashBook allows post-dated
  transactions to be monitored.  The 'Final' column in the account list
  window includes the effect of any post-dated transactions and pending
  standing orders for a specified period of time.  This can provide prior
  warning when large amounts of money are due to leave an account.

  The budget details dialogue, accessed from the main menu at 'Analysis -
  Budget...', allows these options to be changed in the 'Post-dated
  transactions' section. 'Trial standing orders for X days' indicates how
  many days' worth of future standing orders are included in the 'Future'
  value and can be set to "0" to disable the feature.  If 'Restrict
  transactions' is set, post-dated transactions entered into the transaction
  window are also limited to this period: any transactions which are further
  ahead do not appear anywhere in the calculated values.



Reporting and Analysis
----------------------

  CashBook's analysis facilities allow reports to be generated, providing
  information on the accounts and analysis headings in a file.  Details can
  be extracted on individual transactions, or on collections of transactions,
  accounts, analysis headings and so on.  This makes it possible to gain a
  much clearer idea of the way in which money is being spent (or saved).

  Reports are text-based, and can be viewed on screen or printed via the
  built-in report viewer.  The contents can be exported in a number of
  formats, including CSV, and several of the reports can be created in a
  tabular layout which is suitable for graphing or loading into a spreadsheet
  for further manipulation.

  The various reports are accessed from the 'Analysis' menu.  Four options
  are available, which are described in detail later in this chapter:

  * Transaction reports allow individual transactions to be shown, based on
    date, account or analysis heading, amount, reference or description.
    Summary totals of the individual accounts and analysis headings can be
    produced, and details on budget targets can also be included.

  * Unreconciled transaction reports allow unreconciled transactions to be
    shown.

  * Cashflow reports show the change in balance of accounts and analysis
    headings over time.  Their output can be in the form of a list, or in a
    tabular format suitable for loading into a spreadsheet.

  * Balance reports indicate snapshots of the balance of accounts and
    analysis headings at the end of given time periods.  As with cashflow
    reports, their output can be in list or tabular format.

  All of the reports can have their entries split into groups by date, and
  the unreconciled reports can also be grouped by account and analysis
  heading.

  The settings used for individual reports can be saved as templates in a
  cashbook file for re-use at a later time.

  The reports fall broadly into two groups.  Transaction and unreconciled
  transaction reports are, at their names suggest, mainly concerned with
  transactions - although the transaction report can also provide useful
  summaries of analysis headings.  Cashflow and balance reports, on the other
  hand, deal with the flow of money in to and out of accounts and analysis
  headings.  Transaction reports can also be used to show income and
  expenditure against analysis headings.

  Since CashBook effectively operates a double-entry system, cashflow and
  balance reports are of most use when looking at accounts in isolation.
  Each transaction has equal but opposite entries in two accounts or analysis
  headings, which results in these reports always totalling to zero if all
  the accounts and headings are included; this is explained in more detail
  when each report is discussed below.  Due to this effect, transaction
  reports are often more use for providing information on spending against
  accounts, analysis headings and budget targets.

  In addition to these general reports, the standing order report allows a
  list of the currently defined standing orders to be produced quickly.


  The report viewer
  -----------------

  The report viewer is used to display completed reports on screen, and
  allows the results to be printed or saved out in a number of different
  formats.  Depending on the report, the CSV output is suitable for importing
  into a spreadsheet or graphing package for further manipulation.

  The fonts used in a report can be changed using the report format dialogue,
  by clicking Menu over the report window and selecting 'Format...'.  Two
  fonts can be specified, for the normal and bold text respectively.  The
  font size can be specified in points, and the line spacing as a percentage
  of the point size.  Default values, to be used for new all new reports, can
  be set in the 'Fonts' section of the choices dialogue.

  The report can be printed from the print report dialogue, opened by
  selecting 'Print...' from the report window menu.  The standard printing
  options are available, allowing the information to be rotated and scaled to
  best fit the paper or to be printed using fast text output if the hardware
  supports this.

  Alternatively, the report contents can be exported in various different
  formats from the report window menu:

  * Plain ASCII text, from the 'Save text' option, saves the content for a
    fixed width font using spaces to pad out the columns.  This is most
    likely to be of use for sending to a printer or including in another
    fixed width document such as an email.

  * Comma separated values (CSV), using the 'Export CSV' option.  CSV files
    are a standard format, used extensively by other applications like
    spreadsheets and graphing packages.  The output differentiates between
    text and numerical data, and splits columns into separate fields.  Some
    reports can produce tabular layouts, which are particularly suited to
    operations like charting.

  * Tab separated values (TSV), using the 'Export TSV' option.  TSV files are
    like CSV, but use tabs (ASCII character 9) instead of commas to separate
    fields and do not differentiate between text and numbers.  The format is
    most likely to be used for importing text into wordprocessors.

  Finally, the settings used to create the report can be saved as a template
  in the file, by selecting 'Save template...' from the report window menu,
  so that they can be re-used in the future.  This is described in the next
  section.


  Saving report templates
  -----------------------

  The settings used for individual reports can be saved as templates in a
  cashbook file, so that they can be re-used at a later date.  Saved reports
  behave in a similar way to any other report, except that the contents of
  the report dialogue will be pre-loaded to the required values.  In
  addition, the name of the report template will appear in the title of the
  finished report.

  The first step to creating a saved report template is to generate the
  required report in the usual way (as described in the following sections).
  Once the report viewer window shows the desired result, select 'Save
  template...' from the menu to open the Save as template dialogue box.

  A name can be entered into the 'Name' field of the dialogue, which will be
  used to identify the template in the saved reports menu.  It will also
  appear in the title of future reports created from the template.  The
  pop-up menu to the right of the field offers a list of any existing
  template names: saving a new template with one of these will cause the
  original template to be overwritten.  Click 'Save' to save the template
  into the file (to make this permanent, the file itself will now need to be
  saved in the usual way).

  Reports generated from templates can themselves be saved as templates in
  exactly the same way.  In this case, the name of the original template used
  to create the report will be offered by default in the Save as template
  dialogue.  Leaving the name unchanged will update the original template
  definition; alternatively the name can be modified to create a new template
  from the report.

  Saved report templates can be accessed from the 'Analysis - Saved reports
  -' sub-menu of the main menu.  Selecting a template from this list will
  open a report dialogue for the report (as described in the following
  sections), with a couple of differences: the template name will be shown in
  the dialogue title, and there will be two additional buttons at the bottom
  of the window.

  Clicking on the 'Delete' button will delete the report template from the
  file.  The template can be renamed by clicking on 'Rename...', which will
  open the Rename template dialogue.  This behaves in a similar way to the
  Save as template dialogue, except that it is not possible to rename the
  template to the same name as another in the file.  Click on 'Rename' to
  change the name.


  Transaction reports
  -------------------

  A transaction report shows details of transactions which meet a given set
  of criteria.  By restricting the report to certain accounts or analysis
  headings, it is possible to produce a report showing income or expenditure
  relating to specific areas.

  The report consists of two parts: a list of all the transactions that match
  the criteria specified, and a summary of the income, expenditure and
  account activity related to those transactions by analysis heading or
  account.

  By using only the analysis heading summary, a report can be produced on
  analysis headings which is similar to that shown in the incoming and
  outgoing headings list windows.  In many situations, this can be more
  useful than the similar output from the cashflow report (described later).

  By using the account summary, a report can be produced which is similar to
  the information shown in the 'Budget' column of the account list window,
  but which relates only to the selected transactions (if no 'Include'
  criteria are set, the information should match that of the account list
  exactly).  This can provide information on account activity related to
  other criteria, unlike the cashflow report, which only provides information
  on overall account activity.

  Transaction reports are useful for breaking income and expenditure up into
  groups, either by analysis heading, by account, or both.  The reported
  transactions show the individual dates and amounts of money involved, while
  the summaries show totals over the periods of the report.

  If the report is created for the current budget period (by selecting the
  'Use budget period' option), the summaries contain additional information
  relating to the budget limits.  Along with the 'total' amount allocated to
  each heading, the 'budgeted' amount is shown, calculated from the number of
  days in the grouped period and the number of days in the whole budget
  period.  The 'balance' for the grouped period is the difference between the
  amount budgeted and the amount actually spent in that period, while the
  'remaining' value shows the amount remaining from the whole budget period.

  Selecting 'Analysis - Transaction report...' from the main menu will open
  the Transaction report dialogue.

  The date range over which the report will be compiled is set in the
  'Period' section.  Lower and upper limits can be set by entering dates into
  the 'From' and 'To' fields; if either are left blank, the earliest and
  latest dates in the file are used respectively.  If 'Use budget period' is
  set, the current budgeting date range will be used instead of any entered
  values.

  The way that transactions are grouped is set in the 'Groupings' section.
  If the report is ungrouped, all the selected transactions will be shown in
  one block, with a single summary at the end.  If 'Group transactions' is
  ticked, the transactions will be broken up into chunks as shown and each
  section will have its own summary at the end.

  The period of each group is given in the 'Group by' field, and can be
  specified in days, months or years.  If 'Lock to calendar' is on, groups
  will always end on a calendar boundary (the end of a month or year),
  regardless of the start date specified.

  The 'Include' section contains the criteria for selecting which
  transactions to include.  The 'From' and 'To' fields specify the accounts
  or analysis headings to which the transactions must relate: a transaction
  is included if it matches an entry in EITHER the from or to list.  If both
  lists are left blank, all transactions will be included.

  Accounts and headings are entered into the include fields in comma
  separated lists of idents, like this: "11,M4,T2".  Clicking on the pop-up
  menu icons to the right of the fields, or pressing F1 (the 'quick entry
  key') with the caret present, will open the account entry window; this will
  allow the idents to be entered in the usual way.  An asterisk ("*") can be
  used to signify 'any' in one field if the other has specific idents
  entered.

  The selection of transactions can be further narrowed down using the
  'Reference', 'Amount' and 'Description' fields: if any of these are
  specified, the transaction must match the values given.  The amount field
  can be given either a lower limit, and upper limit, or both, while both the
  reference and description fields can be given a piece of text to match.
  The text comparison uses standard wildcards, where "#" matches a single
  character and "*" matches zero or more different characters.

  Finally, the 'Output' section contains options to select whether the
  transaction entries or the summaries are included in the report.  Any
  combination can be selected.

  Once the options have been set, clicking on 'Generate' will create the
  report and display it in a report viewer.


  Unreconciled Transaction reports
  --------------------------------

  An unreconciled transaction report provides details of transactions in the
  cashbook file which have not been reconciled.  This makes it possible to
  identify items which have not appeared on statements, which can potentially
  highlight errors.

  Selecting 'Analysis - Unreconciled report...' from the main menu will open
  the Unreconciled transaction report dialogue.

  The date range over which the report will be compiled is set in the
  'Period' section.  Lower and upper limits can be set by entering dates into
  the 'From' and 'To' fields; if either are left blank, the earliest and
  latest dates in the file are used respectively.  If 'Use budget period' is
  set, the current budgeting date range will be used.

  If 'Group transactions' is ticked, transactions in the report will be
  grouped and shown together, either by date or by account and heading.
  'Group by account and heading' collects transactions together based on the
  unreconciled accounts or headings that they contain in the From and To
  columns.  If both are unreconciled, the transaction will be shown in the
  report twice.

  'Group by date' shows the transactions sorted by the dates that they occur
  on.  The size of each group can be specified in days, months or years.  If
  'Lock to calendar' is ticked, groups will always end on calendar boundaries
  regardless of the start date specified.

  Finally, the 'Include' section allows accounts and headings to be specified
  for inclusion in the report.  If both the 'From' and 'To' fields are left
  blank, all accounts and sections will be used; otherwise, only those
  unreconciled transactions which match one or other of the fields will get
  included.

  Accounts and headings are entered into the include fields in comma
  separated lists of idents, like this: "11,M4,T2".  Clicking on the pop-up
  menu icons to the right of the fields, or pressing F1 (the 'quick entry
  key') with the caret present, will open the account entry window; this will
  allow the idents to be entered in the usual way.  An asterisk ("*") can be
  used to signify 'any' in either of the fields, if the other contains
  specific idents.

  Once the report parameters have been set, click on 'Generate' to create the
  report.


  Cashflow reports
  ----------------

  Cashflow reports show the flow of money in to or out of a set of accounts
  or analysis headings over a given period of time.  Effectively, if the
  balance of an account at the start of the period is A and at the end it is
  B, then the cashflow of that account over that period is B-A.  At the end
  of each period, the cashflow for each account and analysis heading included
  in the report is added together, to give an overall total.

  Due to the double-entry nature of transactions in CashBook, each one will
  create two equal but opposite entries in two separate accounts or headings
  (corresponding to the 'From' and 'To' fields of the transaction).  As a
  result, if a cashflow report is generated including all the accounts and
  analysis headings in a file, every period total will be zero as the two
  halves of each transaction will always cancel out.  It is this fact which
  underpins double-entry book keeping.

  In addition to this, the cashflow for incoming analysis headings will
  always be NEGATIVE, as money always flows FROM the heading to the account
  or heading at the other side of the transaction.  Conversely, outgoing
  headings always have a POSITIVE cashflow, since money always flows TO them
  from another account or heading.

  As a result of these two points, cashflow reports are usually of most use
  when applied only to accounts.  In this situation, they indicate whether
  the balance of an account is rising, falling or merely remaining at a
  constant level.

  Cashflow reports can also be useful when applied solely to analysis
  headings, in which case they indicate the amount of money spent on or
  received from each category during the report period.  Beware that, as
  explained above, incoming headings will always show negative cashflows, and
  outgoing headings positive ones; this can initially seem unintuitive.  The
  information here is effectively the same as that shown in the incoming
  headings list and outgoing headings list windows if the report period is
  either the budget period or the whole file.

  As noted above, producing a cashflow report including all the accounts and
  headings in a file provides a check that the file balances: the totals
  should always be zero if CashBook is doing its job properly! Cashflow
  reports containing an incomplete mix of accounts AND headings may give
  unhelpful (if accurate) results.  An incomplete set of accounts OR headings
  can be useful: it could, for example, show information about a group of
  savings accounts, while ignoring current accounts and credit cards.

  When working with analysis headings, it may be the case that a transaction
  report or the information in the headings list windows (which can of course
  be printed) proves to be of more use.  In the case of the headings list
  windows, this will probably depend on the period over which the report is
  to be run.

  Selecting 'Analysis - Cashflow report...' from the main menu will open the
  Cashflow report dialogue so that a report can be created.

  The date range over which the report will be compiled is set in the
  'Period' section, and follows the standard format.  Lower and upper limits
  can be set by entering dates into the 'From' and 'To' fields; if either are
  left blank, the earliest and latest dates in the file are used
  respectively.  If 'Use budget period' is set, the current budgeting date
  range will be used.

  By default, the report shows figures for the cashflow in each account and
  analysis heading over the whole date range specified.  If 'Group results'
  is ticked, then the report will be broken up into sections as specified by
  'Group by'.  Ticking 'Lock to calendar' ensures that groups will always end
  on calendar boundaries, regardless of the start date.  If no money enters
  or leaves an account or analysis heading during a group period, it will be
  omitted unless 'Include empty groups' is ticked.

  The 'Include' section specifies which accounts and analysis headings to
  include in the report.  If all three fields are left blank, then everything
  will be included; as noted in the explanation above, this may not be that
  useful.

  As soon as one field contains an ident, only the specified accounts and
  headings will end up in the report.  An asterisk ("*") can be used to
  signify 'all' in one or more fields; entering "*" into the 'Accounts' field
  would generate a report including all the accounts and no analysis
  headings, while entering "*" into both the 'Incoming headings' and
  'Outgoing headings' fields would generate a report including all the
  analysis headings in the file.

  Accounts and headings are entered into the include fields in comma
  separated lists of idents, like this: "11,M4,T2".  Clicking on the pop-up
  menu icons to the right of the fields, or pressing F1 (the 'quick entry
  key') with the caret present, will open the account entry window; this will
  allow the idents to be entered in the usual way.

  The 'Tabular format' option at the bottom of the dialogue determines the
  format used by the report.  When off, the standard format is used and
  entries run down the page.  If ticked, the results are arranged in a table
  with the accounts and headings across and dates running down: this is a
  handy format for importing into spreadsheets or graphing packages.  There
  is a maximum limit of 20 columns to the table, and if this will be exceeded
  (if there are more than 20 accounts and headings included), requests for
  the tabular format will be ignored.

  Once the report parameters have been set, click on 'Generate' to create the
  report.


  Balance reports
  ---------------

  A balance report shows the balances of a set of accounts or analysis
  headings at the end of a given period.  By grouping the report, it can show
  how the balances vary over time.  At the end of each period, the balances
  of every account and analysis heading in the report are summed to give an
  overall total.

  As with cashflow reports, the double-entry nature of transactions in
  CashBook can cause all the totals to be zero if every account and analysis
  heading in a file is included: if a transaction moves £10 from a heading to
  an account in isolation, the heading's balance will be £-10 and the
  account's balance will be £+10 afterwards.  Summing these balances gives a
  total balance of £0.

  However, unlike a cashflow report, this will not hold true if any accounts
  have opening balances specified.  In this case, the total shown in each
  report will be the total of the opening balances of all the accounts
  included in the report.

  Still in a similar way to cashflow reports, the balances for incoming
  analysis headings will always be negative, while the balances for outgoing
  headings will always be positive.  This is because incoming headings are
  effectively paying money out, into your accounts; outgoing headings, on the
  other hand, are always accruing the money paid out from your accounts.

  As a result, and as with cashflow reports, balance reports will usually be
  of most use when applied to either accounts OR analysis headings but not
  both at the same time.  When applied to accounts, they show the amount of
  money contained in those accounts; when grouped by time, an indication of
  how those balances have changed over time is also provided.

  Used with analysis headings, a balance report shows how the total income or
  expenditure of a heading increases over time.  This is distinct from
  information returned from a transaction report (or cashflow report), which
  shows the income or expenditure totalled for each time period.

  Selecting 'Analysis - Balance report...' from the main menu will open the
  Balance report dialogue.

  The date range over which the report will be compiled is set in the
  'Period' section, and follows the standard format.  Lower and upper limits
  can be set by entering dates into the 'From' and 'To' fields; if either are
  left blank, the earliest and latest dates in the file are used
  respectively.  If 'Use budget period' is set, the current budgeting date
  range will be used.

  By default, the report shows figures for the balance of each account and
  analysis heading at the end of the date range specified.  In normal use, it
  is generally more useful to tick 'Group results', so that the balance for
  each account or heading is shown at the end of each group period (for
  example at the end of each month).  Ticking 'Lock to calendar' ensures that
  groups will always end on calendar boundaries, regardless of the start
  date.

  The 'Include' section specifies which accounts and analysis headings to
  include in the report.  If all three fields are left blank, then everything
  will be included; as soon as one field contains an ident, only the
  specified accounts and headings will end up in the report (but "*" can be
  used to signify 'all' in a field if others have idents specified).

  Accounts and headings are entered into the include fields in comma
  separated lists of idents, like this: "11,M4,T2".  Clicking on the pop-up
  menu icons to the right of the fields, or pressing F1 (the 'quick entry
  key') with the caret present, will open the account entry window; this will
  allow the idents to be entered in the usual way.

  The 'Tabular format' option at the bottom of the dialogue determines the
  format used by the report.  When off, the standard format is used and
  entries run down the page.  If ticked, the results are arranged in a table
  with the accounts and headings across and dates running down: this is a
  handy format for importing into spreadsheets or graphing packages.  There
  is a maximum limit of 20 columns to the table, and if this will be exceeded
  (if there are more than 20 accounts and headings included), requests for
  the tabular format will be ignored.

  Once the report parameters have been set, click on 'Generate' to create the
  report.


  Standing Order Reports
  ----------------------

  A standing order report gives details of the orders currently defined in a
  cash book file.  Selecting 'Analysis - Standing order report' from the main
  menu or 'Full report' from the standing orders list menu will create the
  report.

  The report lists all the details of each standing order, including the
  accounts and headings concerned, amounts to be transferred, the number of
  transactions, dates and so on.  No parameters can be set for the report.



Printing
--------

  The contents of most CashBook windows can be printed, to provide a hard
  copy of the data they contain.  For printing to work, a printer driver must
  have been loaded at some point during the current session.  If your printer
  supports text-mode printing, CashBook can use this to produce a faster
  print job at the expense of flexibility.

  To print the contents of a window, select 'Print...' from the window's menu
  or click on the 'print' button in the toolbar.  In the case of the
  transaction window, the menu option is 'File - Print...' from the main
  menu, and the Print key can also be used.

  When printing the transaction window or statement view contents, there is
  an option to restrict the printed dates to a given range: enter dates in
  the 'from' and/or 'to' fields as required.  If either is left blank, the
  first and last dates in the file are used respectively.  Clicking on
  'Print' will start the print job.

  The default options for printing, including the choice between standard and
  fast text, are set in the 'Printing' section of the choices window.


  Standard printing
  -----------------

  The default method of printing uses outline fonts, which can be scaled as
  required.  This method is the most flexible, allowing the text to be sized
  and rotated to provide the best fit on a page, but on older printers it can
  also be slow.  Selecting 'Standard printing' will use this mode.

  The 'Portrait' and 'Landscape' options determine the orientation of the
  text on the page.  Using landscape will allow longer lines to fit on a
  single sheet of paper, at the expense of getting fewer lines per page.
  Setting 'Scale to fit pages' will shrink the text size if this is required
  to fit the whole width on one page.  Otherwise, the printout will be tiled
  across as many sheets of paper as necessary.

  The margins used for are those set in the 'Printing' section of the choices
  window.  If these are set to be smaller than the current printer's margins,
  a warning will be given and the margins will be temporarily increased.  The
  fonts used for printing are the ones set in the 'Fonts' section of the
  choices window (which also set the default font for the report viewer).


  Fast text printing
  ------------------

  If your printer supports text mode printing, 'Fast text printing' can be
  used to speed up the print job.  The printer's internal font will be used,
  meaning that the outline font settings are ignored.  It is no longer
  possible to scale the print size down to fit on a single page width, and
  data wider than this may not print correctly (the page width is defined by
  the printer's default font).  Landscape printing is also not available,
  unless it can be set in the Printers application.

  When printing in text mode, the 'Use text formatting' option determines
  whether an attempt is made to use bold and underline styles to produce the
  same effect as the outline font printing uses; this will depend on the text
  settings in the RISC OS printer driver and the ability of the target
  printer.



Saving and Loading
------------------

  Saving a cashbook file is done in the usual RISC OS way, by opening the
  'File - Save' dialogue from the main menu, clicking on the 'save file'
  button in the transaction window toolbar or pressing F3.  Enter a name in
  the save as dialogue, and drag the file to a directory viewer; if a full
  path is present, clicking 'OK' or pressing Return will save to the same
  location.

  In addition to using the save as dialogue, a file which has already been
  saved (and hence has a full pathname showing in the titlebar of the
  transaction window) can be saved instantly with an Adjust click on the
  'save file' button or by pressing Ctrl-f3.

  Cashbook files contain details of all the transactions, as well as
  definitions of all accounts, analysis headings, standing orders,
  transaction presets and report templates that have been set up.  Budgeting
  details are saved, as are column widths for all the windows.


  Loading files
  -------------

  A cashbook file can be loaded by double-clicking on it in a filer window,
  as long as CashBook has been 'seen' by the filer or is loaded on the
  iconbar.  Files can also be dragged to the iconbar icon.

  The file format has been defined to be as backwards compatible as possible.
  If files from an old version of CashBook are loaded into a newer version,
  missing information is usually set to a sensible default value where
  possible.  If the file is subsequently saved, this additional information
  will be included in the file.

  Going the other way, older versions of CashBook will just ignore any
  information that they do not understand: if this happens, a warning will be
  given.  Saving the file again will cause this additional information to be
  lost: be careful!


  File information
  ----------------

  Information about a cashbook file can be found by selecting 'File - Info'
  from the main menu or by pressing Ctrl-f1.

  The file information dialogue shows the location of the file on disc, if it
  has been saved, along with the date it was saved and whether there are
  unsaved modifications in memory (also shown by an asterisk at the end of
  the transaction window title bar).

  The dialogue also shows how many accounts, analysis headings, transactions,
  standing orders and transaction presets are in the file.



Import and Export
-----------------

  CashBook can import and export data in a number of formats.  Transaction
  details from other applications can be imported in comma separated value
  (CSV) format, while data can be exported from any of CashBook's windows as
  comma or tab separated values (CSV or TSV), or in the case of reports, as
  plain text.


  Importing data
  --------------

  At present, data import is fairly inflexible and geared to bringing data in
  from Apricote's Personal Accounts using the CSV format.  To import
  transactions, drag a CSV file (with filetype CSV, or &DFE) into a
  transaction window.  If the window already contains some transactions, the
  new data will be added to the end.

  The file should contain lines of data in the following format:

    <date>,<to>,<from>,<reference>,
      <debit>,<credit>,<balance>,<description>

  The <date>, <reference> and <description> fields are imported directly: the
  date must be in a format that would be accepted if it were typed into a
  CashBook window.

  The <from> and <to> fields contain account or analysis heading names and
  idents, in the format "Ident:Name".  If a new ident is encountered, a
  suitable account or analysis heading is created: accounts are assumed to
  have numerical idents (eg. '11'), while analysis headings are assumed to
  have alphanumeric ones (eg. 'A1').

  If any ident appears to be blank (either because the format of the field is
  incorrect or because it is empty), a message will be displayed but the
  import will continue.

  The amount transferred in the transaction is read from the <debit> and
  <credit> fields, depending upon which one is populated; if both are
  present, the <debit> amount is used.  The <balance> value is thrown away.

  When the import has been completed, the import complete dialogue will open,
  showing the number of transactions successfully imported along with the
  number of lines that were rejected due to errors.  This can be dismissed by
  clicking on 'Close'.

  For more detailed information about the import, click on 'View log...' to
  show a record of all the lines found in the file.  Each entry shows whether
  it was imported or rejected, and the fields are shown as CashBook found
  them.  The log is a standard report, and can be saved or printed in the
  normal way by clicking Menu over it.  See the Reporting and Analysis
  chapter for more details.


  Importing data from Personal Accounts
  -------------------------------------

  As noted in the preceding section, the CSV import facilities of CashBook
  are mainly intended for importing data from Apricote's Personal Accounts.
  The following process should be followed to import transaction data into
  CashBook.

   1. In Personal Accounts, ensure that the 'Reconciliation' options show a
      'User typed character' of "#", a 'Display reconciled character' of ""
      and a 'Display un-reconciled character' of a single space.

   2. Go to the Reports 1 dialogue.  Under 'Columns to include in report',
      tick 'Date', 'From', 'To', 'Ref', 'Total', 'Balance' and 'Description'.
      Make sure that 'Include summary of income & payment headings used in
      report' is not ticked.  Clear all the fields under 'Entries to include
      in report', and untick 'Auto-Monthly'.  Save the report as a CSV file,
      using the centre file icon under 'Save/export Report'.

   3. Open the exported file in a text editor, by Shift-double-clicking on
      it.  Delete the lines from the top and bottom of the file which are not
      transactions (the header and summary lines).  Re-save the file.

   4. Open a new transaction window in CashBook, by clicking on its iconbar
      icon.  Drag the CSV file into the window.  This will import the
      transactions, and create any accounts or analysis headings that are
      used.

   5. Although accounts and headings will have been created, they will not be
      sorted as they were in Personal Accounts.  It will be necessary to go
      into the accounts list and headings list windows and re-arrange the
      entries as required.

   6. If any accounts or headings were not used by the imported transactions,
      these need to be manually entered.

   7. Account details, such as initial balances, cheque numbers and bank info
      will need to be entered by hand.

   8. Any standing orders in the original file will need to be created from
      scratch.


  Exporting Data
  --------------

  Data can be exported from CashBook as comma separated values and tab
  separated values files, for use in spreadsheets and word processors.  Most
  windows' menus have 'Export CSV' and 'Export TSV' entries which allow this
  to be done (the transaction window has the options in the 'File' sub-menu
  of the main menu.

  The report window also contains the option to export data as
  space-delimited ASCII text.  This is described in more detail in the
  Reporting and Analysis section.



Finding transactions
--------------------

  It is possible to locate transactions within a cashbook file in two ways.
  If the date or transaction number is known, it can be jumped to using the
  goto transaction dialogue; if not, the find transaction dialogue can be
  used to look for the correct entry based on a number of criteria.


  Going to a transaction
  ----------------------

  If you know the date or number of a transaction, it is possible to go
  direct to it using the goto transaction dialogue.  Open it by selecting
  'Transactions - Goto...' from the main menu, or by clicking on the 'goto
  transaction' button in the transaction window toolbar.

  Simply enter the date or transaction number into the 'Transaction' field,
  selecting 'Date' or 'Number' as appropriate, and click on 'Go'.  If the
  transaction exists, the caret will be placed in the date field; if not, a
  message will indicate this.


  Searching for transactions
  --------------------------

  If the date or transaction number is not known, or if several similar
  transactions need to be located, then the file can be searched based on the
  contents of a combination of any of the transaction fields.  The find
  transaction dialogue is opened by selecting 'Transactions - Find...' from
  the main menu, or by clicking on the 'find transaction' button in the
  transaction window toolbar.

  The top section of the dialogue allows the contents of some or all of the
  fields to be specified.  Any combination can be used, and it is possible to
  find transactions where all of the specified fields match or where any one
  or more match.  Values are entered as they would be in a transaction entry,
  with the same entry keys used for reconciliation of accounts and headings.

  The reference and description fields can include wildcards if required. "*"
  will match any number of characters, including none, while "#" will match
  any single character.  Unless the 'Case sensitive' option is on, upper and
  lower case are treated as the same in both fields.

  The 'And' and 'Or' switches determine how multiple fields are treated.  If
  'Or' is selected, then any transactions where one or more of the specified
  fields match will be found.  If 'And' is selected, all the specified fields
  must match for a transaction to be found.

  The 'Search direction' can be set to search forwards or backwards from the
  current location of the caret, or from the start or end of the file, as
  required.  Click 'Find' to start the search.


  Search results
  --------------

  If any matching transactions are found, the found transaction dialogue will
  open and the caret will be placed in the first matching field of the line.
  The dialogue shows which fields matched and gives the transaction number.

  The 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons allow the search to continue in either
  direction using the same parameters. 'New search' allows the current search
  parameters to be modified, while 'Cancel' will abort the search.



Purging Data
------------

  After a time, cashbook files will contain old data which is no longer
  needed.  While this is not actually a problem, it may be desirable to
  remove old transactions which have been reconciled, unused accounts and
  analysis headings, and completed standing orders.

  It is possible to carry out this process as part of a year-end routine,
  removing old transactions before saving the file under a new name.  This
  ensures that records are maintained, while also reducing the amount of
  'clutter' in the working copy of the file.

  The process is carried out from the purge file dialogue, which can be
  opened by selecting 'File - Purge...' from the main menu.  Four options are
  available, allowing each type of item to be purged as required.

  If 'Remove reconciled transactions' is selected, all transactions where
  both the 'From' and 'To' fields are reconciled will be removed.  If a date
  is supplied in the 'Keep transactions from' field, only transactions taking
  place before that date will be deleted.  It is not possible to purge
  unreconciled transactions.

  'Remove unused accounts' and 'Remove unused headings' allow any accounts or
  analysis headings to be removed if they are not referred to in any
  transactions or standing orders.  This process is done after transactions
  and standing orders have been purged, so it will remove any accounts or
  analysis headings left unused following the purge.  Note that in this
  context, 'used' means referred to in a transaction, standing order, or
  transaction preset.

  Finally, 'Remove completed standing orders' will remove any standing orders
  which have either completed or been stopped.

  To start the purge, click on 'Purge'.  Once the process has completed, the
  filename is removed from the file so that it can not accidentally be saved
  back over the original; instead, the file must be dragged to a filer window
  again.



Configuration
-------------

  A number of aspects of CashBook's operation can be adjusted and configured
  to suit individual users' tastes, computer or geographical location.  To
  access the choices dialogue, select 'Choices...' from the iconbar menu.

  The choices dialogue is split into a number of sections, which are
  described below.  To close the window and apply any changes made, click on
  the 'Apply' button; to save the changes so that they will be used the next
  time CashBook is loaded, click on 'Save'.


  General choices
  ---------------

  The 'General' choices contain a number of options which do not fit in
  elsewhere.  They include general user interface issues and control over the
  way that dates are handled.

  If 'Remember dialogue contents' is ticked, the contents of dialogue boxes
  will be retained the next time they are opened.  When opening a dialogue
  from a toolbar button, the contents can be cleared by using an Adjust-click
  instead of Select (the contents can not be cleared when opening from a
  menu).  If the option is off, this behaviour is reversed, so that by
  default dialogue contents are cleared, but can still be retained if an
  Adjust-click on a toolbar button is used.

  The 'Desktop interface' section contains a couple of options relating to
  the general interface.  If 'RISC OS 5 keyboard' is selected, keys such as
  Home and End follow the RISC OS 5 Style Guide; otherwise, they follow the
  old Acorn guidelines.  This option is selected by default on any system
  running RISC OS 5, but can be overridden manually. 'Support global
  clipboard' determines whether CashBook handles global cut, copy and paste
  from the transaction window.  It should be turned off if system wide
  support is available (eg. if Select or Adjust's icon selection is on, or if
  an add-on module like IcnClipBrd is present).

  The 'Dates' section controls the way in which dates are handled.  The
  'Input separators' field contains a list of symbols which can be used to
  separate the sections of a date on entry.  By default this is "-/\.", which
  means that dates can be entered as "DD-MM-YYYY", "DD/MM/YYYY", "DD\MM\YYYY"
  or "DD.MM.YYYY". 'Display separator' is the symbol to be used whenever a
  date is displayed or printed.  The 'Use territory calendar info' option
  tells CashBook to get information about the structure of dates (eg. the
  number of days in each month) from the system.  This should usually be left
  on; if turned off, CashBook uses its own default values.


  Currency choices
  ----------------

  The 'Currency' choices determine the way in which CashBook handles monetary
  values.

  The 'Show zeros' option determines whether a zeros are displayed, or
  whether the fields or cells with a zero value are left blank.  It affects
  all windows, dialogue boxes, exported files and printed pages.

  The remainder of the section determines the currency and the way in which
  numbers are formatted.  It is usually best to leave 'Use territory
  defaults' set, and allow CashBook to get the information from the system.
  If the option is turned off, the remaining settings can be changed.

  'Decimal places' sets the number of digits following the decimal point: in
  most currencies, this will be 2.  The 'Decimal point' can also be
  specified, to allow the full-stop to be replaced by other symbols such as a
  comma.

  The way in which 'Negative values' are shown can be adjusted.  If 'Minus
  sign' is used, numbers appear as '-1.23', whereas if 'Brackets' is chosen,
  they will be formatted as '(1.23)'.


  Transaction choices
  -------------------

  The 'Transactions' section controls some aspects of the transaction
  window's behaviour.

  If 'Automatically sort transactions' is set, pressing Return in the sorted
  field of a transaction (ie. the field whose column heading shows the sort
  indicator) will automatically sort it into the correct place in the window.
  Any affected statement views will also be re-sorted.

  'Allow full transaction delete' enables or disables the use of Ctrl-F10 in
  the transaction window for clearing whole transactions in one go.

  'Highlight reconciled entries' will allow transactions with both the 'From'
  and 'To' fields reconciled to be shown in a different colour.  The
  'Highlight colour' can be selected in the field below, by clicking on the
  pop-up icon.

  The length of the Adjust-click menus over the 'Reference' and 'Description'
  fields of the transaction window can be specified using the 'Limit
  completion menus to X items' field.  If set to a number greater than zero,
  the menus will include at most that many entries collected from the
  transactions nearest to the mouse click.  Set this to "0" to make the
  length of the menus unlimited.

  If 'Automatically sort presets' is on, the contents of the preset list
  window will be re-sorted after new presets are added.


  Account and analysis heading choices
  ------------------------------------

  The 'Accounts' section controls the behaviour of the accounts and analysis
  headings, including the statement view windows.

  If 'Highlight overdrawn balances' is ticked, entries in the accounts list
  window will be displayed in a different colour if they go overdrawn.
  Similarly, entries in the outgoing headings list will be highlighted if
  they go over the specified budget limit, while entries in the incoming
  headings list will be highlighted if they fail to reach the budgeted
  amount.  The 'Highlight colour' can be selected in the field below, by
  clicking on the pop-up icon.

  In the 'Statement views' section, the 'Highlight heading entries outside
  budget' option allows entries in the analysis heading statement views to be
  shown in a different colour if they fall outside the current budget range.

  The 'Highlight overdrawn account entries' will display the balances in
  account statement views using a different colour if they go below the
  specified credit limit.


  Standing order choices
  ----------------------

  The 'Standing orders' section controls the way in which standing orders
  behave.

  If 'Sort after adding standing orders' is on, the contents of the
  'transaction' window and any open statement views will be sorted into date
  order after any new standing orders are added.

  If 'Automatically sort standing orders' is on, the contents of the standing
  order list window will be re-sorted after new standing orders are added.
  This can be useful for ensuring that the next standing orders to be applied
  always end up at the top of the window.

  The remainder of the section deals with what CashBook views as 'weekend
  days' for the purposes of avoiding them when picking dates to add standing
  orders. 'Use territory defaults' is usually selected, and the information
  is read from the system.  If it is unset, the days that comprise the
  weekend can be set manually.


  Printing choices
  ----------------

  The 'Printing' section controls the printing options, including print
  margins and the default settings.

  The 'Standard printing' and 'Fast text printing' options determine the
  default mode to be used for print jobs.  Standard uses RISC OS fonts and
  should work with all but the most elderly of printers; while it will be
  slower on old hardware, it allows more options for scaling text and fitting
  it on the page.  Fast text will only work on printers that offer a text
  mode: this is mainly old dot-matrixes and PostScript devices.  It has the
  advantage of speed, but is much less flexible in terms of layout and
  formatting.

  When printing in standard mode, the text can be placed on the page in
  either 'Portrait' or 'Landscape' mode; the latter is useful if there are
  long lines present.  Ticking 'Scale width to fit page' will ensure that
  print jobs always come out one page wide, by reducing the font size until
  the widest line fits.

  The font used for printing is the one set in the 'Fonts' section of the
  choices.

  The 'Print margins' should be set to keep the page contents away from the
  edges of the paper.  They are measured from the edge of the paper, and
  should be larger than the margins set in the printer drivers; if they are
  not, a warning will be given whenever a page is printed.

  For fast text printing, the 'Use text formatting' option can be used to
  include bold and underline formatting on the page.  This depends on support
  from both the printer itself and from the text mode drivers in the RISC OS
  printing system.


  Fonts choices
  -------------

  The 'Fonts' section of the choices allows the default font details to be
  set for the report window.  The fonts are also used for printing in
  standard mode.

  'Normal font' and 'Bold font' are the fonts used for normal and bold text
  respectively.  The 'Font size' for both can be set in points, and the 'Line
  spacing' is given as a percentage of the font size.

Future Plans
------------

  CashBook is a work in progress so if there is a feature that you think
  would be useful let me know.

  Now that a stable version 1.20 is available, the following ideas are under
  consideration; other suggestions for new features are welcome.

  * Reporting based on monthly variance.
  * Better CSV import, allowing fields to be specified and the format of
    account names, idents and reconciled flags to be changed.  Allow the
    option of TSV import.
  * QIF import/export, with reconciliation from internet banking records.
  * More flexible import options for other accounts data.
  * More flexible standing order date options.
